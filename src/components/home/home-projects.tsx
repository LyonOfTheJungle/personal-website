		description: "My Deswik process maps redefine efficiency in mining operations. By crafting modules that connect seamlessly to remote databases, I've eliminated the need for laborious Excel exports, streamlining data uploads effortlessly. Additionally, my innovative process map ensures reliable export of drill holes to ring setouts for surveys, saving valuable time by eliminating the 20-minute data processing tasks. Furthermore, I've designed modules that automate the setup of drill holes for straightforward timing plans in underground spaces. These customized Deswik process maps not only enhance precision but also revolutionize workflows, ensuring a significant boost in productivity across various facets of mining operations",
